Android Face Detection Example Readme

With the release of Google play services 7.8, Google added Mobile Vision APIs. This API includes a new framework that allows camera to face track in the Android app. And there are also several benefits like auto exposure, auto facelock, etc which makes the user-experience more impressive.

Thus, I finally decided to create a demo on it and written a tutorial: [Introducing Face Track Feature With Android Face Detection Example](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-face-detection-example/)

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your Android app and looking to [hire Android app developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-android-developer/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
